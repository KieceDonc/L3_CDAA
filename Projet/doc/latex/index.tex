Not much (yet)~\newline
 It allows the manipulation of simple objects that will later be core to the application.~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Creation, edition and deletion of contacts.~\newline

\item Creation, edition and deletion of Interactions.~\newline

\item Extracting Todos from Interactions.~\newline

\item Maintaining a conceptually correct link between Todos and Interactions.~\newline

\item Getting a complete log history of all the actions performed. ~\newline
~\newline
 Although it is not implemented yet, it has been developped according to the principles of relational databases (here SQLite) \+:~\newline
 Therefore the {\bfseries{ACID}} database properties are here ascertained (the most important one being atomicity)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_runStep}{}\doxysubsection{Running the app}\label{index_runStep}
For now, the app works only in console. The object files are in the build repertory. Run them using the ./ command The main will test basic functions \+: Creating two contacts, changing their logs, adding their todos, printing debug values, deleting everything and closing.
